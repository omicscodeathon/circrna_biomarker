# Identifying LncRNA and circRNA Biomarkers in Adult Febrile Patients of Malaria and CoVID-19 Using RNA-seq

## Background
The pathogenesis of infectious diseases depends on the interaction of host and pathogen.
Patients with malaria always present overlapping clinical presentation like COVID-19 infection.
Many febrile patients are misdiagnosed due to the paucity of seroprevalence data malaria and COVID-19 coinfection.
RNA-seq provides a sensitive method for global gene expression analysis in infection disease.

## Problem statment
Differentiate the etiology of febrile patient if is either malaria or COVID-19.

## Objective of the study.
 We will examined the immune system responses of patient infected with malaria and COVID-19 to identify a unique biomarker signature in both infections.
### Specific objectives.
 1. Comparing expression patterns of mono infection and co-infection.
 2. Determine differentially expressed genes and synergistic pathways involved.

## Hypothesis
We hypothesize that the transcriptomic profiles from febrile patient with malaria  and COVID-19 are associated with the overlapping symptoms.
