## Background


The pathogenesis of infectious diseases depends on the interaction of host and pathogen.
Patients with malaria always present overlapping clinical presentation like COVID-19 infection.
Many febrile patients are misdiagnosed due to the paucity of seroprevalence data malaria and COVID-19 coinfection.
RNA-seq provides a sensitive method for global gene expression analysis in infection disease.

## Problem statment
Differentiate the etiology of febrile patient if is either malaria or COVID-19.

## Objective of the study.
 We will examined the immune system responses of patient infected with malaria and COVID-19 to identify a unique biomarker signature in both infections.
### Specific objectives.
 1. Comparing expression patterns of mono infection and co-infection.
 2. Determine differentially expressed genes and synergistic pathways involved.

## Hypothesis
We hypothesize that the transcriptomic profiles from febrile patient with malaria  and COVID-19 are associated with the overlapping symptoms.

## Our Target
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are divided into two sections small non-coding RNAs and long non-coding RNAs(lncRNA). Normally, the ncRNAs with less than 200 nucleotides are classified as shorter such as tRNAs, miRNAs, snoRNAs, siRNAs, and rRNAs while ncRNAs with more than 200 nucleotides and unlikely to encode proteins are classified as 

**LncRNA** can: 
1. Regulate gene at the transcriptional level (by interacting with DNA, RNA and proteins)
2. Modulate chromatin structure
3. Affect RNA splicing
3. Modulating histone

## Results
Quality control of dataset (i.e Quality control of one COVID-19 patient).
